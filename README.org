#+STARTUP: showall

* My emacs config
I started using emacs somewhat recently and came from sublime, so sorry for any weirdness :). I mostly made the switch because it's free, and also free, and I wanted to learn me some lisp.
I was mostly 'inspired' by various configs I found on github, but I've got a few customisations of my own too.
It's currently geared more towards web development, but I would like to do more with it, so hopefully this should be updated.

** TODO Things to do
   - Group buffers in ibuffer and use that for grouping tabs
   - Clean up multicursor customisations
   - Clean up counsel + ivy + swiper
   - Clean up indent level settings
   - 26.1 line numbers
