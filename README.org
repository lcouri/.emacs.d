#+STARTUP: showall

* My emacs config
  This config is mostly a mishmash of packages and things that I needed at the time - there's not too much structure to it ðŸ˜…

  Major things:
  - early init
  - org-mode
  - use-package

  I've borrowed a few things from mostly from doom-emacs, and other configs and threads I've come across.
  It's currently geared more towards web development.
  I use the native-comp branch (compiled myself) with regular emacs 27 as a fallback, on arch linux. I sometimes use emacs in windows as well, so there is some support for it as well.

** TODO lsp-mode
   I have this setup locally, just haven't committed it because it's way too messy right now (although it does technically work). Will get round to committing it eventually... ðŸ¦¥
